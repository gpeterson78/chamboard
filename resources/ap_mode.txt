Overview:
	1.	Use wpa_supplicant to manage WiFi connections to known access points.
	2.	Use hostapd and dnsmasq to set up the Pi as an access point if no WiFi connection is available.
	3.	Automate this behavior with a boot script that determines whether to connect to WiFi or start the access point.

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Install Required Packages

Make sure the necessary tools are installed on the Pi:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y hostapd dnsmasq wireless-tools

2. Configure the WiFi Client (Known Networks)

Edit the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf file to list your known WiFi networks:

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Add the following (replace SSID and PASSWORD with your network credentials):

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US

network={
    ssid="YourWiFiSSID"
    psk="YourWiFiPassword"
    priority=1
}

# Add additional networks as needed

Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

3. Configure the Access Point

Hostapd (WiFi AP)

Edit /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf to configure the AP:

sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

Add the following:

interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=ChamboardAP
hw_mode=g
channel=7
wmm_enabled=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0

Link the configuration file to the hostapd default configuration:

sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd

Set:

DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"

Dnsmasq (DHCP Server)

Edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf:

sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf

Add:

interface=wlan0
dhcp-range=192.168.1.2,192.168.1.50,255.255.255.0,24h

4. Configure the Network Interface

Edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf to define the static IP for the AP mode:

sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

Add:

interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.1.1/24
nohook wpa_supplicant

5. Create a Boot Script

Create a script to check for WiFi and decide whether to start the AP:

sudo nano /usr/local/bin/chamboard-network.sh

Add:

#!/bin/bash

# Check if a WiFi network is connected
if iwgetid -r; then
    echo "WiFi connected to $(iwgetid -r)."
else
    echo "No WiFi connection found. Starting Access Point..."
    sudo systemctl stop wpa_supplicant
    sudo systemctl start hostapd
    sudo systemctl start dnsmasq
fi

Make the script executable:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chamboard-network.sh

6. Automate the Script on Boot

Edit /etc/rc.local to call the script:

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

Before the exit 0 line, add:

/usr/local/bin/chamboard-network.sh &

7. Reboot and Test

Reboot the Pi:

sudo reboot

Validation:
	•	If a known WiFi access point is available, the Pi should connect to it.
	•	If no WiFi access point is available, the Pi should start an access point (ChamboardAP) with DHCP enabled.

elderly parent epaper display reminder - work in progress

this started as a fork of Jan Miksovky's [momboard](https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/momboard ) however I quickly realized I wanted to take this project in a different direction.  since I've got a wordpress site, I decided to use it as the place to curate the content for my *chamboard*.

I'm throwing things at the wall, seeing what sticks but since I'm rolling my own hardware for this one, I might as well roll my own software (ha!) as well.

oh yeah, this is also going to be where the static chamboard site lives.  fun.
